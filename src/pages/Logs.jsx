      <h1>About</h1>
      <p>
        Welcome to react Quiz Maker, your all in one tool for creating, sharing
        and displaying quizzes. I am Seán Osborne and I started coding this
        react Quiz Maker site on the 7th of October 2023, but Quiz Maker started
        a while before that. I started working on the original Quiz Maker on the
        24th of June 2023 using vanilla HTML, CSS and JS, mostly for the purpose
        of improving my knowlege of JS. In a similiar way, my reason for
        creating this one using React was to better my understanding of React.
      </p>
      <p>
        Aswell as this I wanted to create a tool to help me study. When revising
        I like to make quizzes to help me memorise information, but I would use
        tools like google docs or sheets to create them which wasn't great, so I
        decided to create a better way to do that. This idea turned into the
        Quiz Maker site that you see today.
      </p>
      <p>
        Using React for this project instead of vanilla JS has been a game
        changer. I have been able to get stuff done faster and to implement more
        advanced features than with the original Quiz Maker, such as the share
        feature and the sidemenu to name a few.
      </p>
      <p>
        The share feature I have realised can be used in a few interesting ways,
        thanks to the quizzes being shared in a purely text format. This allows
        users to put their quizzes in any file or form that contains text. So,
        in theory one could back up all their quizzes in a text file on their
        computer or in their google drive to be accessed from anywhere.
      </p>
      <p>
        Another cool implication of it being all text is that it means ChatGPT
        or other A.I. chatbots are able to create quizzes in the text format.
        For example you can ask ChatGPT to generate a quiz about capital cities,
        but to put it in the format of a Quiz Maker quiz{" "}
        {"(Make sure to paste in an example of the Quiz Maker format)"}. I have
        tried it myself and it works fantastically. It means that you could
        paste your study material or an already made quiz into ChatGPT and then
        get it to generate a quiz that you can put straight into Quiz Maker and
        use for revision. The possiblities are endless!
      </p>
      <p>
        Another feature that I was able to implement with React was the "Q-Cards
        Display Mode". I have to clarify however that this was heavily inspired
        by my friend Dylan Roche's Q-Card website project. However, I made sure
        that mine was very basic and it is missing a lot of the features that
        Dylan's has. I will make sure to add a link to his site once it's been
        published.

        So that is Quiz Maker. If you managed to find this page of the site then
        you probably know me personally, but if you don't then good on you.
        Thanks for visiting this site and I hope you found it useful. If you
        have any suggestions or other queries, feel free to contact me at the
        email address listed above this article. Happy Quiz Making! Bye!
